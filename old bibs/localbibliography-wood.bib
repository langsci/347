	Abstract = {In this paper, we argue that Applicatives can occur without verbs, more specifically, internal to nouns and adjectives, as previously proposed by Ingason (2015, 2016). We extend Ingason's theory and separate the noun-internal Root-Selecting Event Applicative of the Icelandic type (Applexp) from another Root-Selecting Applicative attested in Basque (referred to here as Applgoal). Evidence supporting this hypothesis comes from two empirical domains: (i) result/process nominals taking datives attested in the syntax of headlines, where no v is projected at all; and (ii) predicative configurations headed by adjectives and process nouns taking internal datives. On the basis of distributive and morphological evidence, as well as constituency tests, we argue that the presence of these internal datives is independent from v. On the other hand, we depart from Ingason's analysis in that the Root-selecting Applicative of the Basque type, although related to an event, does not strictly correspond to Pylkk{\"a}nen's High Appl projection, but rather resembles the Low one in that it introduces goal/source datives. Finally, we show that the Appl projection introducing experiencer datives in Basque is in fact dependent on the projection of v.},

@article{Kastner2018,
	Abstract = {Modern Hebrew exhibits a non-concatenative morphology of consonantal ``roots'' and melodic ``templates'' that is typical of Semitic languages. Even though this kind of non-concatenative morphology is well known, it is only partly understood. In particular, theories differ in what counts as a morpheme: the root, the template, both, or neither. Accordingly, theories differ as to what representations learners must posit and what processes generate the eventual surface forms. In this paper I present a theory of morphology and allomorphy that combines lexical roots with syntactic functional heads, improving on previous analyses of root-and-pattern morphology. Verbal templates are here argued to emerge from the combination of syntactic elements, constrained by the general phonology of the language, rather than from some inherent difference between Semitic morphology and that of other languages. This way of generating morphological structure fleshes out a theory of morphophonological alternations that are non-adjacent on the surface but are local underlyingly; with these tools it is possible to identify where lexical exceptionality shows its effects and how it is reined in by the grammar. The Semitic root is thus analogous to lexical roots in other languages, storing idiosyncratic phonological and semantic information but respecting the syntactic structure in which it is embedded.},

	Abstract = {Recent accounts of process nominals postulate a VP within the nominalized structure. A verb becomes a nominal by a head raising operation to a nominal affix. This view contrasts with analyses of process nominals as (pure) nominals with partial verbal properties, originally due to Chomsky (1970). Contributing to this debate, we will argue that direct evidence indicates that English process nominals contain a VP. Our evidence comes from the distribution of adverbs on the one hand, and from the presence of the VP anaphor do so in process nominals on the other. We show that a portion of the verbal extended projection specifically excluding IP or CP is present in process nominals. An array of word order facts about process nominals falls into place when we further assume that the verb is raised from VP over the subject, the object, and adverbs, adjoining to a nominal affix. Our analysis moreover adds to the evidence for functional structure above VP and supports particular claims about the syntax-morphology interface.},

@book{Borer:2013,
	Abstract = {This is the second volume of three in the Structuring Sense series. This three-volume book sets out to demonstrate that the explanation of linguistic competence should be shifted from lexical entry to syntactic structure, from memory of words to manipulation of rules. Its reformulation of how grammar and lexicon interact has important implications for linguistic, philosophical, and psychological theories about the human mind and language. The book departs from both language specific constructional approaches and lexicalist approaches to argue that universal hierarchical structures determine interpretation, and that language variation emerges from the morphological and phonological properties of inflectional material. This volume applies this radical approach to event structure. Integrating research results in syntax, semantics, and morphology, the author shows that argument structure is based on the syntactic realization of semantic event units. The topics this volume addresses include the structure of internal arguments and of telic and atelic interpretations, accusative and partitive case, perfective and imperfective marking, the unaccusative-unergative distinction, existential interpretation and post-verbal subjects, and resultative constructions. The languages discussed include English, Catalan, Finnish, Hebrew, Czech, Polish, Russian, and Spanish.},

	Abstract = {Phase Theory is the latest empirical and conceptual innovation in syntactic theory within the Chomskyan generative tradition. Adopting a cross-linguistic perspective, this book provides an introduction to Phase Theory, tracing the development of phases in minimalist syntax. It reviews both empirical and theoretical arguments in favor of phases, and examines the role phases play at the interface with semantics and phonology. Analyzing current phasehood diagnostics, it applies them in a systematic fashion to a broad range of syntactic categories, both phases and non-phases. It concludes with a discussion of some of the more contentious issues in Phase Theory, involving cross-linguistic variation with respect to phasehood and the dynamic versus static nature of phases.},

	Abstract = {This paper uses dialect data to disentangle the contributions of phonology and morphology to the emergence of gender syncretism in the Dutch determiner paradigm. Quantitative and spatio-statistical analyses are used to identify an inverse relationship between phonological erosion and adoption of the innovative syncretic system, counter to expectation. That inverse relationship is shown to obscure the parallel development of the determiners in masculine and feminine contexts, leading to the suggestion that the syncretism results from a single morphological change triggered by phonological variability.},

It is argued that both ?? and ?? are modal particles marking specific types of verbal mood. They are connected with the verb in a zone between morphology (lexicon) and syntax, namely through the process of VCF. This also holds for the clitic auxiliaries within perfect tense formation. Furthermore, the Complementizer Phrase (CP) is assumed to be the place where existential quantification of the predicate's event variable is marked in syntax (going hand in hand with existential presupposition). ??-expressions are analyzed as Modal Phrases (ModPs) lacking a CP layer, from which it can be concluded that there is no existential presupposition. It is assumed that the latter takes place on},

@article{Geist2010,
	Abstract = {This paper explores the difference between the short form (SF) and the long form (LF) of predicate adjectives in Russian. It shows that the morphosyntactic and semantic differences between the two forms can be accounted for by assuming a categorial distinction between them known from the cross-linguistic typology of adjectives: the SF is a verbal category, whereas the LF forms a separate class of adjectives. This categorial difference can be explained by the difference in the argument structure. The SF has an argument structure similar to that of stative verbs: it introduces a referential argument for states and instantiates primary predication. The LF however introduces no referential argument and instantiates secondary predication. All morphosyntactic and semantic differences between the SF and the LF can be traced back to the difference in argument structure. A formal analysis of the whole byt' 'be' sentence reveals that the SF combines with the auxiliary byt', which only specifies},

	Abstract = {The present paper is concerned with 'reflexivised' verbs of emotion in Russian such as radovat'sja or zlit'sja, which are, as a rule, regarded as the subject-experiencer derivation of a basic non-reflexivised object-experiencer verb (i.e. radovat' and zlit'). However, upon closer analysis these verbs reveal an event structure that differs in crucial respects from that of true subject-experiencer verbs such as ljubit' or uva∏at'. The need of positing reflexivised verbs of emotion as a separate type besides subject experiencer and non-reflexivised object experiencer verbs can be seen from their ability to appear in the construction 'direct speech + verb of emotion'. It will be shown that it is the event structure of reflexivised verbs of emotion that is basic for both the ability of those verbs to appear in that construction and the 'utterance'-interpretation they are ascribed there.

@article{Yip1987,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a theory of surface case which bears a strong formal similarity to autosegmental theory in phonology and morphology. We suggest that surface case forms a tier which is autonomous of phrase structure-and which is associated with NP's of the PS tier by general principles analogous to those which associate tones with segments, or phonemic melodies with CV skeleta. We show that this theory permits parameterization of a variety of case systems, and thus provides some insight into how case might be characterized in Universal Grammar. The theory permits, most strikingly, a unification of Accusative and Ergative systems under one simple parameter, and explanation of the mysterious appearance of postverbal nominative case in the passives of certain Icelandic ditransitive verbs.},

	Abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper shows that Saramaccan and Gungbe exhibit a complementizer system that provides room for discrete functional projections, the heads of which are realized as markers that encode C-type features (e.g., interrogative, topic, focus) and whose specifiers host distinct fronted elements. These projections occur between Force and Finiteness, which delimit the complementizer system, and may be realized by various modal particles in Saramaccan and Gungbe. It is argued that the Saramaccan form fu represents two complementizer types: fu1, which encodes irrealis mood under Force, and fu2, which realizes deontic modality under Fin(iteness). The same holds for the Gungbe conditional complementizer n1, which merges under Force, and n2, which expresses deontic modality under Fin. This would mean that both Force and Fin express mood specifications, contrary to what is commonly assumed in the literature.},

	Abstract = {English and Dutch middle verbs have a grammatical subject that is the corresponding transitive verb's object. In this paper we will account for this fact by invoking the properties of a pre-syntactic level of semantic representation and its interplay with syntax proper. We will argue that the grammatical subject of a middle is its actual external argument, and we will propose a model of projection of arguments that allows for this. We will show that other special properties of middle constructions follow from the way the verb's logical subject is represented at the pre-syntactic level of representation. In particular, it will be shown that the Affectedness Condition on middle formation is not a condition on the type of argument that can appear as the middle verb's grammatical subject, but that its effects and some exceptions to it naturally follow from this representation. Our model will also allow an account of Dutch impersonal and `adjunct' middles.},

	Abstract = {Fox and Pesetsky (henceforth F&P) propose an architecture for the mapping between syntax and phonology which relates a number of different constraints on movement to the way in which phrase structure is linearized. They investigate Object Shift (henceforth OS) and Quantifier Movement (henceforth QM) in Scandinavian and argue that the restrictions on these processes, namely Holmberg{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s Generalization (HG) effects on OS and what they call {\^a}€˜{\^a}€˜the inverse Holmberg effect{\^a}€{\texttrademark}{\^a}€{\texttrademark} on QM, reflect a requirement for preservation of the order established in the VP due to the fact that the VP is a Spell-out domain. F&P{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s proposal relies on Holmberg{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s (1999) formulation of HG which has been challenged by Anagnostopoulou (2002) on the basis of data discussed in Anagnostopoulou (2003) that directly contradict Holmberg (1999). It is my goal here to investigate how these data can be accommodated in F&P{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s system. I will argue that even though F&P can, in principle, account for the data in question, the attempt to unify the restrictions on OS, QM with comparable restrictions on passivization under F&P{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s architecture fails to express certain crosslinguistic generalizations which are straightforwardly captured in traditional locality accounts.

@phdthesis{Barlow:1988us,
	Abstract = {This dissertation focusses on the nature of the agreement relation. Agreement is usually considered to be a redundancy relation expressed as a morphosyntactic dependency. This view leads naturally to a formalization of agreement as a coindexing relation or an identity function mapping the agreement features of the noun source of agreement onto the agreeing category. The mechanisms encoding the identity function vary, but the underlying assumptions remain the same. An alternative, somewhat surprising view of agreement which emerges from this study is that agreement is neither redundant (necessarily) nor a morphosyntactic relation. Agreement relations are, rather, a part of situated discourse; well-formedness is based on semantic/pragmatic properties, not morphological features. It is argued that the source and target of agreement are not directly linked by an agreement relation. Instead, they instigate discourse referents, which consist mainly of properties that are determined by morphological form. The linking of discourse referents is controlled the Internal Consistency Condition and Saliency Hierarchy Condition. These mechanisms are formalized within the framework of a Discourse-Linking Theory (DLT) of agreement. The failure of the redundancy account of agreement is illustrated in Chapter 2, where it is shown that a view of agreement based on the merger of partial information associated with the source and targets of agreement is preferable. A different perspective on agreement as a carrier of information is investigated in Chapter 3. A survey of fifteen unrelated languages is undertaken to discover the relation between agreement morphology and classificatory information. This typological study reveals the kinds of semantic/pragmatic information that is encoded cross-linguistically in agreement morphology, thus highlighting the link between agreement and cognition. A survey of feature discord is also presented. The question of the information structures relevant to agreement is dealt with in Chapter 4. Eight properties of agreement are identified, which are shown to be only partially accounted for by syntactic and semantic treatments of agreement. Chapter 5 presents a basic sketch of DLT, some predictions, and a treatment of the eight properties of agreement. In Chapter 6, DLT is applied to the analysis of agreement in Arabic and English.},

@article{Bobaljik:2005rt,
	Abstract = {This volume{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s two target articles explore novel approaches to word order alternations, especially Scandinavian Object Shift. They share the common perspective that aspects of linear order long considered the exclusive purview of syntax may be better understood if the burden of explanation is split between phonological and syntactic modules. The two articles differ substantially, however, in how this general hunch plays out, in particular in the amount of the explanation that is attributed to extra-syntactic factors. Fox and Pesetsky{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s {\^a}€˜{\^a}€˜Cyclic Linearization{\^a}€{\texttrademark}{\^a}€{\texttrademark} model (hereafter F&P, CycLin ) is compatible with familiar syntactic models, and can be seen as a filter running (cyclically) on the output of syntactic derivations. F&P suggest that their proposal can explain various heretofore stipulated conditions on syntactic operations as consequences of the architecture of their system and a single axiom about linearization. Erteschik-Shir{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s proposal in {\^a}€˜{\^a}€˜Sound Patterns of Syntax{\^a}€{\texttrademark}{\^a}€{\texttrademark} (hereafter E-S) is more radical, in the sense that far less of the familiar syntax is retained; where for CycLin movement is still a syntactic process, on E-S{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s view a good deal of traditionally syntactic movement must be rethought in linear, rather than hierarchical terms. Both articles are largely exploratory and leave many of the details still to be spelled-out. To engage the ideas on specifics, then, will involve to some degree making some educated guesses about what ancillary assumptions the relevant authors might condone. I will therefore restrict myself to a few comments at a general level, though it will be impossible to do justice to these authors{\^a}€{\texttrademark} ideas in the allotted space.

	Abstract = {This is the second volume of three in the Structuring Sense series. This three-volume book sets out to demonstrate that the explanation of linguistic competence should be shifted from lexical entry to syntactic structure, from memory of words to manipulation of rules. Its reformulation of how grammar and lexicon interact has important implications for linguistic, philosophical, and psychological theories about the human mind and language. The book departs from both language specific constructional approaches and lexicalist approaches to argue that universal hierarchical structures determine interpretation, and that language variation emerges from the morphological and phonological properties of inflectional material. This volume applies this radical approach to event structure. Integrating research results in syntax, semantics, and morphology, the author shows that argument structure is based on the syntactic realization of semantic event units. The topics this volume addresses include the structure of internal arguments and of telic and atelic interpretations, accusative and partitive case, perfective and imperfective marking, the unaccusative-unergative distinction, existential interpretation and post-verbal subjects, and resultative constructions. The languages discussed include English, Catalan, Finnish, Hebrew, Czech, Polish, Russian, and Spanish.},

	Abstract = {This book explores the difference between words however defined and structures however constructed. It sets out to demonstrate over three volumes {\^a}€'' of which this is the first {\^a}€'' that the explanation of linguistic competence should be shifted from lexical entry to syntactic structure, from memory of words to manipulation of rules. Its reformulation of how grammar and lexicon interact has profound implications for linguistic, philosophical, and psychological theories about human mind and language. The book departs from both language specific constructional approaches and lexicalist approaches to argue that universal hierarchical structures determine interpretation, and that language variation emerges from the morphological and phonological properties of inflectional material. This volume applies this radical approach to nominal structure. Integrating research in syntax, semantics, and morphology, the volume argues that nominal structure is based on the syntactic realization of semantic notions such as classifier, quantity, and reference. In the process, this volume seeks to do away with lexical ambiguity and type-shifting. Among the topics the volume considers are the interpretation of proper names, the mass-count distinction, the weak-strong interpretation of quantifiers, partitive and measure phrases, and the structural representation of the definite article. In the process, the volume explores inter-language variation through the properties of the morpho-phonological system. The languages discussed include English, Chinese, Italian, and Hebrew.},

	Abstract = {Williams syndrome (WS) is a neuro-developmental disorder which is characterized by an unusual fractionation of language abilities and other cognitive functions. We have investigated four cases of English-speaking subjects with WS, and we show that despite their low IQs the WS children's performance on syntactic tasks and on regular inflection is not impaired. Irregular inflection, however, is affected causing many errors. We also report results from studies investigating the same linguistic phenomena in children with specific language impairment. These children exhibit a different pattern of impairment, with relatively poor performance on syntactic tasks and regular inflection. We suggest a linguistic characterization of the morphosyntax in WS according to which WS subjects are impaired in accessing (particular kinds of) information from lexical entries, with their computational system for language appearing to be intact. We interpret the selective impairments found in WS and SLI as supporting the theoretical distinction between a computational system and an associative memory system for language.},

@article{Clifton-Jr:2006bv,
	Abstract = {Two experiments investigated the acceptability of multiple questions. As expected, sentences violating the Superiority Condition were accepted less often than sentences obeying it. The status of the Superiority violations was not improved by the addition of a third wh, regardless of whether the third wh was an adjunct or an argument, though it was improved by the addition of a second question (e.g., and when). Further, in a small pilot study directly comparing a sentence with adjacent final wh-phrases that may induce a stress clash (I'd like to know who hid it where when) with a sentence violating Superiority but avoiding the final adjacent wh-phrases (I'd like to know where who hid it when), half the participants indicated that the Superiority violation sentence sounded better. This suggests that the status of some additional-wh sentences may appear to improve simply because the comparison sentence with adjacent final wh-phrases is degraded. Overall, the results of the studies suggest that there is no need to complicate syntactic theory to account for the additional-wh effect, because there is no general additional-wh effect.

	Abstract = {This study investigates brain responses to violations of information structure in wh-question-answer pairs, with particular emphasis on violations of focus assignment in it-clefts (It was the queen that silenced the banker). Two types of ERP responses in answers to wh-questions were found. First, all words in the focus-marking (cleft) position elicited a large positivity (P3b) characteristic of sentence-final constituents, as did the final words of these sentences, which suggests that focused elements may trigger integration effects like those seen at sentence end. Second, the focusing of an inappropriate referent elicited a smaller, N400-like effect. The results show that comprehenders actively use structural focus cues and discourse-level restrictions during online sentence processing. These results, based on visual stimuli, were different from the brain response to auditory focus violations indicated by pitch-accent [Hruska, C., Steinhauer, K., Alter, K., & Steube, A. (2000). ERP effects of sentence accents and violations of the information structure. In Poster presented at the 13th annual CUNY conference on human sentence processing, San Diego, CA.], but similar to brain responses to newly introduced discourse referents [Bornkessel, I., Schlesewsky, M., & Friederici, A.

	Abstract = {This book offers a perspective on the structure of human language. The fundamental issue it addresses is the proper balance between syntax and semantics, between structure and derivation, and between rule systems and lexicon. It argues that the balance struck by mainstream generative grammar is wrong. It puts forward a new basis for syntactic theory, drawing on a wide range of frameworks, and charts new directions for research. In the past four decades, theories of syntactic structure have become more abstract and syntactic derivations have become more complex. The book traces this development through the history of contemporary syntactic theory, showing how much it has been driven by theory-internal rather than empirical considerations. It develops an alternative that is responsive to linguistic, cognitive, computational, and biological concerns. At the core of this alternative is the Simpler Syntax Hypothesis: the most explanatory syntactic theory is one that imputes the minimum structure necessary to mediate between phonology and meaning. A consequence of this hypothesis is a richer mapping between syntax and semantics than is generally assumed. Through analyses of grammatical phenomena, some old and some new, the book demonstrates the empirical and conceptual superiority of the Simpler Syntax approach.},

	Abstract = {Fox and Pesetsky (F&P) make the claim that certain constraints on Object Shift and Quantifier Movement in Scandinavian can be explained within their model of the mapping between syntax and phonology. Among the salient features of this model are: Spell-out occurs phase-by-phase (as in recent work by Chomsky 2000, 2001a,b), and linearization relations established at each Spell-out point must be preserved (F&P{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s property of Order Preservation). As F&P demonstrate quite elegantly, this system enforces successive cyclicity in wh -movement, in that non-successive-cyclic derivations will result in an ordering contradiction (violating Order Preservation). Thus, the {\^a}€˜{\^a}€˜cyclicity{\^a}€{\texttrademark}{\^a}€{\texttrademark} of successive cyclicity is shifted to being a by-product of the cyclic spelling-out process. One might still ask why Spell-out itself is cyclic, but this is certainly a welcome simplification.

The theory is based on concepts such as Phase Impenetrability and its constraints in syntactic relationships, Inherent Phase predication, and Phase Extension of the predicate head. Examples are given of: Predicate Inversion constructions and locality; Movement of small-clause predicates up to a RELATOR which in turn is raised to a functional head outside the clause; and Mathematical models showing the minimal domain of a head-movement chain.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, I explore what a purely phonological account of object shift (OS) involves and what research questions it leads to, in particular what it means for word order to be phonologically motivated and what morpho-phonological primitives are involved. I pursue the possibility that what licenses OS of full DPs in Icelandic is phonological properties, not found in other Scandinavian languages, together with overt case marking. Although the position of the object is determined phonologically, the architecture I propose, in which topic and focus play a central role, allows for an account of the semantic effect associated with OS in Icelandic.

	Abstract = {Our proposal is concerned with the relation between an aspect of phonology (linearization) and syntax. In the picture that we had in mind, the syntax is autonomous {\^a}€`` {\^a}€˜{\^a}€˜it does what it does{\^a}€{\texttrademark}{\^a}€{\texttrademark} {\^a}€`` but sometimes the result maps to an unusable phonological representation. In this sense, linearization acts logically as a filter on derivations. We know of no evidence that the syntax can predict which syntactic objects will be usable by the phonology, and we know of no clear evidence that the phonology communicates this information to the syntax. In this sense, our proposal fits squarely into the tradition that Svenonius characterizes as the {\^a}€˜{\^a}€˜mainstream{\^a}€{\texttrademark}{\^a}€{\texttrademark}. We thus attempted to identify certain deviant configurations that are not plausibly excluded for syntax-internal reasons, but are filtered out in the linearization process.

@article{Fox:2005an,
	Abstract = {This paper proposes an architecture for the mapping between syntax and phonology {\^a}€`` in particular, that aspect of phonology that determines the linear ordering of words. We propose that linearization is restricted in two key ways. (1) the relative ordering of words is fixed at the end of each phase, or {\^a}€˜{\^a}€˜Spell-out domain{\^a}€{\texttrademark}{\^a}€{\texttrademark}; and (2) ordering established in an earlier phase may not be revised or contradicted in a later phase. As a consequence, overt extraction out of a phase P may apply only if the result leaves unchanged the precedence relations established in P. We argue first that this architecture ({\^a}€˜{\^a}€˜cyclic linearization{\^a}€{\texttrademark}{\^a}€{\texttrademark}) gives us a means of understanding the reasons for successive-cyclic movement. We then turn our attention to more specific predictions of the proposal: in particular, the effects of Holmberg{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s Generalization on Scandinavian Object Shift; and also the Inverse Holmberg Effects found in Scandinavian {\^a}€˜{\^a}€˜Quantifier Movement{\^a}€{\texttrademark}{\^a}€{\texttrademark} constructions (R{\~A}¶gnvaldsson (1987); J{\~A}³nsson (1996); Svenonius (2000)) and in Korean scrambling configurations (Ko (2003, 2004)). The cyclic linearization proposal makes predictions that cross-cut the details of particular syntactic configurations. For example, whether an apparent case of verb fronting results from V-to-C movement or from {\^a}€˜{\^a}€˜remnant movement{\^a}€{\texttrademark}{\^a}€{\texttrademark} of a VP whose complements have been removed by other processes, the verb should still be required to precede its complements after fronting if it preceded them before fronting according to an ordering established at an earlier phase. We argue that {\^a}€˜{\^a}€˜cross-construction{\^a}€{\texttrademark}{\^a}€{\texttrademark} consistency of this sort is in fact found.

	Abstract = {The article refers to "Phase Extension Contours of a theory of the role of head movement in phrasal extraction," by Marcel den Dikken, and to locality in the Minimalist framework. The commentary discusses Minimal Link Condition (MLC), phases in syntactic derivations, and the Phase Impenetrability Condition of Chomsky (2000) which strengthens MLC. The focus is whether or not the phasal status of a predication structure is fixed and if the small clause with a RELATOR head is a phase. Predicate inversion, minimal domain in Chomsky (1995), linguistic models, and wh-elements of extraction are mentioned.},

	Abstract = {Functional dissociations within the neural basis of auditory sentence processing are difficult to specify because phonological, syntactic and semantic information are all involved when sentences are perceived. In this review I argue that sentence processing is supported by a temporo-frontal network. Within this network, temporal regions subserve aspects of identification and frontal regions the building of syntactic and semantic relations. Temporal analyses of brain activation within this network support syntax-first models because they reveal that building of syntactic structure precedes semantic processes and that these interact only during a later stage.},

The acoustic vowel space of Modern Greek and German. Language Speech, 32, 221-248]. In this study, we investigated whether this acoustic expansion in production has a perceptual correlate, that is, whether the perceived distance between pairs of sounds separated by equal acoustic distances varies as a function of inventory size or organization. We used magnetoencephalography, specifically the mismatch field response (MMF), and compared two language groups, French and Spanish, whose vowel inventories differ in size and organization. Our results show that the MMF is sensitive to inventory size but not organization, suggesting that speakers of languages with larger inventories perceive the same sounds as less similar than speakers with smaller inventories.},

Such data can be obtained by magnetoencephalography (MEG) that tracks cortical activation sequences with a millisecond temporal accuracy.

As examples of MEG's role in cognitive neuroscience, we discuss time windows related to cortical processing of sensory and multisensory stimuli, effects of the subject's own voice on the activity of their auditory cortex, timing of brain activation in reading, and cortical dynamics of the human mirror-neuron system activated when the subject views another person's movements.},

	Abstract = {Although natural language appears to be largely compositional, the meanings of certain expressions cannot be straightforwardly recovered from the meanings of their parts. This study examined the online processing of one such class of expressions: concealed questions, in which the meaning of a complex noun phrase (the proof of the theorem) shifts to a covert question (what the proof of the theorem is) when mandated by a sub-class of question-selecting verbs (e.g., guess). Previous behavioral and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) studies have reported a cost associated with converting an entity denotation to an event. Our study tested whether both types of meaning-shift affect the same computational resources by examining the effects elicited by concealed questions in eye-tracking and MEG. Experiment 1 found evidence from eye-movements that verbs requiring the concealed question interpretation require more processing time than verbs that do not support a shift in meaning. Experiment 2 localized the cost of the concealed question interpretation in the left posterior temporal region, an area distinct from that affected by complement coercion. Experiment 3 presented the critical verbs in isolation and found no posterior temporal effect, confirming that the effect of Experiment 2 reflected sentential, and not lexical-level, processing.},

	Abstract = {What the theories of Fox& Pesetsky (F&P) and Erteschik-Shir (ES) have in common is that they both account for Holmberg{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s Generalization (HG) in terms of linearization. That is virtually the only thing they have in common, though, and even that is more a nominal than a substantial resemblance. For one thing, in F&P it is a matter of linearization of VP constituents as part of the narrow-syntactic derivation, in ES a matter of linearization of adverbs in relation to verb and object in a model where phonology / prosody determines word order. They can{\^a}€{\texttrademark}t both be right, but they can both be wrong, which, however, we can{\^a}€{\texttrademark}t be certain of until the set of hypotheses they propose have been thoroughly investigated and tested. Below I will present some critical remarks on both theories, pointing out some possible false predictions in F&P in section 2, and one or two possible flaws in ES in section 3. In section 4 I will consider how the two theories fare with respect to properties of Object Shift (OS) which they do not themselves take up. In section 5 I will briefly consider the problem of inverted objects. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR Copyright of Theoretical Linguistics is the property of Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co.

This paper focuses on the loss of OV orders in the history of Icelandic, showing that change in word order cannot always be explained in terms of changes in morphology (loss of case). A modified version of earlier analyses of OV orders in Older Icelandic illustrates how mixed OV/VO word order patterns are due to a) information structure and prosodic parameters and b) that the pertinent change in the history of Icelandic can be adduced to one rule, namely the extraction of non-finite VPs out of complex finite VP.},

	Abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;Selection---the tendency of derivational affixes to choose the category of their base---has most often been couched in terms of syntactic categories such as Noun, Verb, and Adjective. In recent years several theories have claimed, however, that roots are categoryless, and receive category only by virtue of being merged with functional projections of various sorts. This article examines three such theories---Distributed Morphology, Borer's Exo-Skeletal model, and DiSciullo's Asymmetrical Morphology, and determines that none of them can handle the phenomenon of affixal selection. We may, however, maintain the claim that roots lack syntactic category if we make use of a system of lexical semantic categorization that allows us to state selection in terms of semantic categories. It is shown that the framework of Lieber (2004) allows for such categorization, and moreover that semantic categorization permits us to make generalizations that are not available in a theory in which selection is purely on the basis of syntactic category.},

Our data set consists of responses evoked by the voiced syllables /bae and /dae/ and the corresponding voiceless syllables /pae/ and /tae/. The data yield well to principal component analysis (PCA), with a reasonable subspace in the order of three components out of 37 channels. To discriminate between responses to the voiced and voiceless versions of a consonant we form a feature vector by either matched filtering or wavelet packet decomposition and use a mixture-of-experts model to classify the stimuli. Both choices of a feature vector lead to a significant detection accuracy. Furthermore, we show how to estimate the onset time of a stimulus from a continuous data stream.},

I will proceed as follows. In section 2, I briefly sketch main features of Fox& Pesetsky{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s (2005) analysis. Against this background, I discuss some of the properties of the approach developed in M{\~A}¼ller (2000) in section 3. In section 4, the two approaches are compared. Section 5 draws a conclusion.

	Abstract = {It is often assumed that idiomatic constructions basically involve non-compositional meanings (Katz and Postal 1963; Fraser 1970; Chomsky 1980, among others) or special syntax-semantics correspondences (cf. Jackendoff 1990, 1997a, b, 2002). However, we agree with those linguists who claim that there are aspects of idioms that are compositional (Marantz 1996, 1997; Nunberg, Sag, and Wasow 1994). In this article, on the one hand, assuming Hale and Keyser's (2002) configurational theory of argument structure, we show that a class of idiomatic constructions which can be found in both {\^a}€œsatellite-framed languages{\^a}€ like English and {\^a}€œverb-framed languages{\^a}€ like Catalan and Spanish (Talmy 1985, 1991, 2000) involves different applications of a lexical syntactic process of conflation. Unlike Jackendoff (1990, 1997a), we argue that the relevant crosslinguistic variation must be expressed in l(exical)-syntactic terms rather than via correspondence rules. On the other hand, assuming Marantz's (1996, 1997) division of labor between the computational system and the encyclopedia, we show the relevance of syntactic argument structures in structuring the compositional meaning of an idiomatic construction, and that of distinguishing between syntactically transparent compositional meanings and syntactically non-transparent non-compositional ones.

The commentary discusses predicate inversion, double object constructions, the scope of the matrix verb, and a definition of predication. The argument is that constraints on extraction are not completely explained by phase extension when the structure is a predicate inversion. Examples are given of copular inversion, locative inversion, and Dative Shift in constructions based on an underlying small clause. Chomsky's hypothesis, an escape hatch with independent motivation, and the RELATOR head are mentioned.},

This brain specialization is essential to rapid reading ability because it enhances perception of words by becoming specifically tuned to recurring properties of a writing system. The origin of this specialization poses a challenge for evolutionary accounts involving innate mechanisms for functional brain organization. We propose an alternative account, based on studies of other forms of visual expertise (i.e. bird and car experts) that lead to functional reorganization. We argue that the interplay between the unique demands of word reading and the structural constraints of the visual system lead to the emergence of the Visual Word Form Area.},

	Abstract = {Fox and Pesetsky (this issue, henceforth F&P) argue that the {\^a}€˜{\^a}€˜edge effects{\^a}€{\texttrademark}{\^a}€{\texttrademark} derived by stipulation within standard phase theory can be explained in their version, where a phase crucially triggers linearization of its constituents. Later phases may add ordering statements to an ordering table in a monotonic fashion, but no information can be erased or altered once it has entered the ordering table. Suppose a phase A contains the constituents x , y , z , and that they are linearized in that order. Then movement within the next phase can{\^a}€{\texttrademark}t result in reordering of x , y , z . So x , being the leftmost element, can move leftwards freely within the next phase, while y can only move leftwards provided that x moves even further leftwards. This is, in essence their explanation of Holmberg{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s Generalization (Holmberg, 1986, 1999) (HG). To see this, imagine that y in our setup is an object trying to shift, and that x is the verb. They also show that, if y moves to the left edge of A prior to its linearization, this may end up blocking leftwards movement of x in what they term the {\^a}€˜inverse Holmberg{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s Generalization{\^a}€{\texttrademark}, and they have empirical support for the existence of that pattern. This gives a version of phase theory where phases are not entirely opaque to outside syntactic probing. Their proposal is highly innovative and elegant, and it succeeds in deriving an impressive range of facts. The following paragraphs present some relatively minor empirical problems with their treatment of HG which unfortunately seem to conspire to uncover a major one.

	Abstract = {The time course and cortical basis of reading comprehension were studied using magnetoencephalography. The cortical structures implicated most consistently with comprehension were located in the immediate vicinity of the left auditory cortex, where final words totally inappropriate to the overall sentence context evoked enduring activation starting approximately 250 ms and lasting up to 600 ms after word onset. Contextually appropriate but unexpected words produced weaker activation which terminated earlier. Highly anticipated words totally failed to activate this area, suggesting that the conceptual network became involved only if unexpected information was detected during the primary word identification process. We propose that the point in time (350 ms after word onset) where the response to appropriate but unexpected endings started to diverge from those to contextually inappropriate endings reflects the boundary between understanding a single word and the meaning of a whole sentence.},

Gestures, facial expressions, interactional synchrony, eye contact, use of space, touching, aspects of voice modification, and silence are shown to play a crucial role in human interaction and to be highly culture-specific. The implications of this broad paradigm of communication are discussed with respect to language development, and it is suggested that paralanguage be included as a primary facet of communicative competence. Finally, the importance of awareness of paralanguage in the classroom is discussed, and a number of suggestions are made to facilitate students' acquisition of paralanguage.},

Single equivalent current dipole modeling of the fields elicited by all vowel types localized activity to a well-circumscribed area in supratemporal auditory cortex in both hemispheres. There were hemisphere asymmetries in the amplitude and latency of the M100 response. We also observed changes in M100 latency related to vowel type, but not to F0. There was no clear effect of vowel type or F0 on dipole localization for the M100, but a possible vowel type by latency interaction. These M100 data provide further evidence that vowels are processed independently of their pitch.},

	Abstract = {Schreuder and Baayen (Schreuder. R., & Baayen, R. H. (1997). How complex simplex words can be. Journal of Memory and Language 37, 118-139) report that lexical decision times to nouns are not sensitive to the cumulative frequency of the noun's morphological derivatives in its "morphological family", even though such a cumulative frequency effect is obtained in the domain of inflection. Under a decomposition view of derivational morphology, this constitutes a puzzling exception to the robust finding that lexical frequency is one of the major determinants of behavioral response latencies. If morphologically complex words are decomposed, each occurrence of a member of a noun's morphological family should add to its root-frequency. We investigated the effects of morphological family frequency on the magnetoencephalographic response component M350, which shows sensitivity to factors affecting early stages of lexical processing, including lexical frequency. We hypothesized that high morphological family frequency should have a facilitory effect on the M350, even though no such effect can be seen in response time, presumably due to competition among possible root-affix combinations. Contrary to this hypothesis, we found that high family frequency elicits an M350 inhibition, suggesting that competition among morphological family members occurs at the M350. The result is significant, since there is evidence that competition among phonologically similar words occurs after, not at, the M350. Thus, our results suggest that competition within a morphological family precedes competition within a phonological similarity neighborhood.},

It is a follow-up to the longitudinal study of Rice, Wexler, and Hershberger (1998), which reported on the production of grammatical morphemes by young children with SLI and 2 control groups of children, one at equivalent levels of mean length of utterance at the outset of the study, the other of equivalent age. In this investigation, we report on grammaticality judgment measures collected from the same 3 groups of children over a period of 2 years for 5 times of measurement. It is the first longitudinal study of grammaticality judgments of children with SLI. The findings show that children's grammatical judgments parallel their productions: Children with SLI can make fine-tuned grammatical judgments to reject morphosyntactic errors they are unlikely to commit, whereas they accept morphosyntactic errors that they are likely to produce. The findings support the extended optional infinitive (EOI) account of morphosyntactic limitation based in underlying grammatical representations and do not support accounts of input processing deficits or production constraints.},

	Abstract = {Summary: This review will focus on investigations of the auditory evoked neuromagnetic field component, the M100, detectable in the magnetoencephalogram recorded during presentation of auditory stimuli, approximately 100 milliseconds after stimulus onset. In particular, the dependence of M100 latency on attributes of the stimulus, such as intensity, pitch and timbre will be discussed, along with evidence relating M100 latency observations to perceptual features of the stimuli. Comparison with investigation of the analogous electrical potential component, the N1, will be made. Parametric development of stimuli from pure tones through complex tones to speech elements will be made, allowing the influence of spectral pitch, virtual pitch and perceptual categorization to be delineated and suggesting implications for the role of such latency observations in the study of speech processing. The final section will deal with potential clinical applications offered by M100 latency measurements, as objective indices of normal and abnormal cortical processing., Copyright (C) 2000 American Clinical Neurophysiology Society},

	Abstract = {Abstract. This article provides an overview of the three main approaches to raising-to-object sentences like Cindy believes Marcia to be a genius. The article describes the strengths and challenges faced by these accounts, reaching a number of conclusions. First, the covert ''LF'' raising account, though successful at accounting for certain interpretational facts about the construction, does not provide an analysis of the word-order facts. Second, the overt raising account, which can account for the word order facts, still faces two main challenges; there remain important open questions about verb placement, and though none of the current approaches to extraction can easily explain it, extraction and raising-to-object interact in complex ways that are still not well understood. Third, the movement theory of control, which treats object control in a way parallel to overt raising-to-object, faces not only the challenges to the overt raising account, but several others particular to object control. Finally, the article describes the HPSG analysis of raising-to-object, which can account straightforwardly for the word order facts, and with the appropriate constraints can be extended to account for the extraction facts discussed.},

Auditory stimuli were Finnish /pa/ syllables presented together with a videotaped face articulating either the concordant syllable /pa/ (84% of stimuli, V = A) or the discordant syllable /ka/ (16%, V [not equal to] A). In some subjects the probabilities were reversed. The subjects heard V [not equal to] A stimuli as /ta/ or /ka/. The magnetic responses to infrequent perceptions elicited a specific waveform which could be explained by activity in the supratemporal auditory cortex. The results show that visual information from articulatory movements has an entry into the auditory cortex.},

	Abstract = {In this short review I address certain issues and predictions that arise from the position papers by Erteschik-Shir, and by Fox and Pesetsky. The two proposed analyses are radically different, so I have made no attempt to relate them in terms of their properties. In section 1 I discuss some underlying issues in the architecture of grammar assumed by Erteschik-Shir, and in section 2 I evaluate some of the predictions generated by Fox and Pesetsky{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s approach. In section 3 I draw some more general conclusions about what consequences Object Shift shows us concerning the organization of grammar, and the nature of grammatical principles. While my remarks mainly address problems or drawbacks that I see with the proposals in the two position papers, they both offer a stimulating account of OS and explore the wider implications of the natures of their enterprises, and deserve fuller consideration beyond the present venue, consideration that they will surely receive.

	Abstract = {Examples like 'Can't nobody beat 'em.' ('Nobody can beat them.') in African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) have the inverted form of questions but the falling intonation and sentence meaning of (emphatic) declaratives. Labov et al. (1968) concluded that this phenomenon of 'negative inversion' (NI) requires two overlapping but distinct syntactic analyses. Recasting them in current terms, these proposals are Aux-to-Comp movement, as in subject-auxiliary inversion in interrogatives, and a non-movement structure containing a null expletive subject. Two explanatory problems arise with the view that Labov et al. present: (i) why the single phenomenon of NI should find its expression in two distinct structures and (ii) why this inversion phenomenon is restricted to negative sentences. Using ideas from Optimality Theory, we develop a syntactic account of the NI data that also directly addresses problems (i) and (ii). We show that the relevant aspects of the syntax of AAVE and Standard English (SE) can be accounted for in terms of the different rankings of three relevant constraints. The account is driven in part by consideration of an apparent change since the 1960's in the acceptability of NI examples in embedded clauses. Some problems which our research raises, but does not fully resolve, include a complete analysis of the function of NI structures, the explanation for the quantitative favoring of inverted over non-inverted structures, and the extent to which negative inversion in AAVE has changed since the 1960's, in particular whether it has become closer to similar structures found in SE.},

@article{Shalom:2008mg,
	Abstract = {In the past few years, a series of influential review articles have summarized the state of the art with respect to cortical models of language organization. The present article is a mini-review and conceptual meta-analysis of several of the most prominent recent contributions. Based on the models, the authors extract some generalizations to arrive at a more robust model that 1) does justice to the range of neurological data, 2) is more connected to research in linguistics and psycholinguistics, and 3) stimulates hypothesis-driven research in this domain. In particular, the article attempts to unify a few of the current large-scale models of the functional neuroanatomy of language in a more principled manner. First, the authors argue that the relevant type of processing in a given cortical area, that is, memorizing (temporal cortex) versus analyzing (parietal) versus synthesizing (frontal), lies at the basis of local neuronal structure and function. Second, from an anatomic perspective, more dorsal regions within each of these (temporal, parietal, and frontal) systems specialize more in phonological processing, middle areas in syntactic processing, and more ventral areas in semantic processing.

	Abstract = {The likelihood that substrate languages play a key role in pidgin/creole genesis is widely acknowledged; still, because so many instantiations of substratal influence involve phenomena that occur widely in the world's languages, the question arises, for a given pidgin or creole, whether the responsible factor is the substrate or linguistic universals. To separate the specifically substratal from the universal, the present study examines highly marked substratal input and its impact. Resumptive pronouns in relative clauses are considered in two varieties of pidginized Liberian English and in the relevant Niger-Congo languages. The evidence indicates that degree of homogeneity in substratal input bears crucially on the extent of substratal influence in a pidgin or creole.},

	Abstract = {This paper provides a survey of the theoretical and experimental findings on degrees of grammaticality, with a special focus on gradience in syntax. We first discuss the theoretical relevance of gradient data, and argue that such data should be elicited experimentally in order to be reliable. We then review a set of experimental findings on gradience, which lead to the hypothesis that linguistic constraints come in two types: hard constraints whose violations trigger strong unacceptability, and soft constraints that lead to only mild unacceptability. There is experimental evidence that both types of constraints are subject to constraint ranking and show cumulativity and ganging up effects. However, soft and hard constraints differ with respect to context effects, crosslinguistic variation, and developmental optionality. This set of properties forms the basis for an evaluation of existing proposals for models of gradience in grammar, with a particular focus on models that extend Optimality Theory.},

Pylkkanen et al. found evidence that the M350 reflects lexical activation prior to competition among phonologically similar words. We investigate the effects of lexical and sublexical frequency and neighborhood density on the M250 and M350 through orthogonal manipulation of phonotactic probability, density, and frequency. The results confirm that probability but not density affects the latency of the M250 and M350; however, an interaction between probability and density on M350 latencies suggests an earlier influence of neighborhoods than previously reported.},

	Abstract = {Functional neuroimaging, within 10 years, has produced evidence which leads us to question a number of the standard assumptions about the areas which are necessary and sufficient for language processing. Although neuroimaging evidence has corroborated much neuropsychological data, it forces a revision of a number of the standard interpretations of those data and some traditionally accepted notions must be totally discarded. We will provide an overview of some issues which have arisen in these years, giving examples from a number of laboratories and illustrating with experiments of our own. The circumstances under which the left posterior temporal lobe (Wernicke's area) and the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area) are activated are reviewed, and several views of how they contribute to language processing are considered in the light of this evidence. Further evidence for the contribution of a number of other areas to language comprehension are reviewed, including the anterior temporal lobe, the cerebellum, the left superior median frontal lobe, the anterior insula and the left inferior temporal occipital junction. Further we discuss some of the conditions under which the right hemisphere contributes to language processing. We will conclude by discussing the implications of this research for the concept of modularity in the sense of Fodor [Modularity of Mind, MIT Press, Cambridge, 1983].},

I point out two paradoxes the treatment of V2 gives rise to in Erteshik-Shir{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s paper, and dispute the status and effectiveness of processing constraints in accounting for (un)grammaticalities in various word order patterns. I discuss the relation of Fox and Pesetsky{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s cyclic linearization algorithm to {\^a}€˜tucking in{\^a}€{\texttrademark} as well as to the {\^a}€˜Attract Closest{\^a}€{\texttrademark} property of movement. Qualms are raised regarding several apparently stipulative and / or conceptually unattractive properties of the linearization mechanism, and ostensible violations of order preservation are examined.

Den Dikken's views on locality differ from Chomsky (2000, 2001, 2004) which supports a phase-based model of syntax. Den Dikken defines Phasehood in terms of semantic property instead of propositionality and Den Dikken's hypothesis is that head movement extends inherent phases.

	Abstract = {The papers here represent very different analyses of Object Shift (OS), and take very different positions on the interaction of phonology and syntax, an area in which there are many unsettled questions. Mainstream work tends to hold that syntax is blind to phonological content, with certain exceptions, for example sometimes phonetically null elements require special syntactic licensing (Chomsky 1981), or certain syntactic rules only apply to nodes with phonetically visible features (Holmberg 2001). Basically falling within the mainstream are proposals that syntactic movement can be blocked by or driven by requirements that have phonological effect at the output, such as adjacency (Bobaljik 1995, Kidwai 1999) or rules matching prosodic structure with focus structure (Zubizarreta 1998). Such accounts generally describe movements in the syntactic terms of specifiers and feature checking and so on, and do not rely on the visibility to syntax of strictly phonological features. We can call these all Syntactic accounts. Most accounts of OS are Syntactic in these terms, for example those of Holmberg (1986), Holmberg and Platzack (1995), and Bobaljik (1995, 2002).

	Abstract = {Neurones in the human inferior occipitotemporal cortex respond to specific categories of images, such as numbers, letters and faces, within 150-200 ms. Here we identify the locus in time when stimulus-specific analysis emerges by comparing the dynamics of face and letter-string perception in the same 10 individuals. An ideal paradigm was provided by our previous study on letter-strings, in which noise-masking of stimuli revealed putative visual feature processing at 100 ms around the occipital midline followed by letter-string-specific activation at 150 ms in the left inferior occipitotemporal cortex. In the present study, noise-masking of cartoon-like faces revealed that the response at 100 ms increased linearly with the visual complexity of the images, a result that was similar for faces and letter-strings. By 150 ms, faces and letter-strings had entered their own stimulus-specific processing routes in the inferior occipitotemporal cortex, with identical timing and large spatial overlap. However, letter-string analysis lateralized to the left hemisphere, whereas face processing occurred more bilaterally or with right-hemisphere preponderance. The inferior occipitotemporal activations at ~150 ms, which take place after the visual feature analysis at ~100 ms, are likely to represent a general object-level analysis stage that acts as a rapid gateway to higher cognitive processing.},

@article{Thornton:2008da,
	Abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper examines over 900 why-questions gathered in a longitudinal study of an English-speaking child from 2 to 6&nbsp;years of age. The child went through a protracted stage in which many why-questions lacked subject-aux inversion, in contrast to other wh-questions. While this asymmetry has been observed in the previous literature, several new observations also emerged. First, the child permitted focus phrases, topic phrases and subordinate clauses to intervene between why and the subject NP in matrix why-questions with no I to C movement. Second, subject-aux inversion was consistently manifested in long-distance questions with tensed embedded clauses, and in utterances with why that were not information-seeking questions. Based on the pattern of data, it is proposed that some children initially permit why to merge high in the left periphery, in SpecIntP, following a proposal for Italian by Rizzi, L. (2001). On the position ``Int(errogative)'' in the left periphery of the clause. In G. Cinque & G. Salvi (Eds.), Current studies in Italian syntax (pp. 287-296). Oxford: Elsevier. The paper considers whether the child data are best explained (i) by a why-parameter that distinguishes languages permitting merge of why from those languages limited to movement (cf. Ko, H. (2005). Syntax of why-in-situ: Merge into [SpecCP] in the overt syntax. Natural Language and Linguistic Theory, 23, 867-916.), or (ii) as evidence of a universal principle. In the final analysis, the parameter account is preferred, because it explains the individual variation and the sharp transition to the adult grammar that is observed in some children.},

	Abstract = {Italian playwright, director, actor and designer Dario Fo has written and produced more than forty plays in the past forty years, works which have enjoyed a vast audience throughout Europe and much of the rest of the world. Until 1984, however, he was banned from entering the United States by the U.S. State Department. As a result, his plays have only recently come to the attention of American theatre practitioners and scholars. In this study, I analyse Fo's writing and staging techniques to show how he creates a network of practical oppositions which function to undermine his various representations of authority. In order to facilitate this analysis, I divide his oppositional strategies into four general types. The first is a blocking configuration, in which the opposing figure typically upstages the authoritative figure. The second is a linguistic function, in which sub-standard speech patterns overwhelm nomative discourse. The third involves a paradoxical disarticulation within the actor's body, in which one physical element actually undermines another. The fourth is an assault on the notion of integrated character, in which many actors play one role, or one actor plays many roles. Throughout my analysis, I emphasize Fo's manipulation of ancient Roman, guillaresque and commedia dell'arte techniques in order to facilitate his oppositional strategies. Each chapter is devoted to a detailed examination of a specific play. The first chapter concerns itself primarily with We Can't Pay! We Won't Pay!, the second with Mistero Buffo, the third with Accidental Death of an Anarchist and the fourth with Elizabeth. A close investigation of Fo's work shows that his is a complicated strategy, both practically and theoretically. He manipulates a vast network of theatrical devices with exceptional virtuosity in order to create a tightly controlled representation which unambiguously reflects his own political viewpoint.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a theory of surface case which bears a strong formal similarity to autosegmental theory in phonology and morphology. We suggest that surface case forms a tier which is autonomous of phrase structure-and which is associated with NP's of the PS tier by general principles analogous to those which associate tones with segments, or phonemic melodies with CV skeleta. We show that this theory permits parameterization of a variety of case systems, and thus provides some insight into how case might be characterized in Universal Grammar. The theory permits, most strikingly, a unification of Accusative and Ergative systems under one simple parameter, and explanation of the mysterious appearance of postverbal nominative case in the passives of certain Icelandic ditransitive verbs.},

@article{Zanuttini:2008fk,
	Abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperative subjects in English are puzzling in several respects: null subjects are possible with a definite interpretation, unlike in other clause types; quantificational subjects are often restricted to range over a set containing the addressee and exhibit binding possibilities not readily available to them in declaratives and interrogatives; and third person referential subjects are for most speakers limited to bare noun phrases. On the empirical side, this paper provides a comprehensive discussion of these properties that makes sense of the sometimes contradictory observations found in the literature. On the theoretical side, it argues that the syntactic representation of imperatives contains a functional projection not present in other clause types. This projection plays a role both in preventing the instantiation of a predication relation between the subject and the predicate, and, when sufficiently local, in licensing the special syntactic properties of the subject. This proposal differs from those that view the properties of imperative subjects as deriving uniquely from the semantic or pragmatic component; it can be seen as building on the general intuition of the old performative hypothesis, though recasting it at a level of abstraction that captures more adequately the properties of imperatives.},
