  title = {Successive Cyclicity, Anti-Locality, and Adposition Stranding},
  author = {Abels, Klaus},
  year = {2003},
  address = {{Storrs, Connecticut}},
  abstract = {This thesis studies movement operations in natural languages. It is observed that certain heads\textemdash C\textdegree, v\textdegree, and, in most languages, P\textdegree\textemdash cannot be stranded; the complements of these heads never move without pied-piping the heads in question. This is surprising since (a) extraction out of CP, vP, and PP is possible in principle and (b) the complement categories of these heads, TP, VP, and DP or PP, are movable. Evidence for the more contentious of these claims is provided in chapters 3 and 4. Chapter 4 also investigates the ramifications of these facts for theories of adposition stranding. All heads in question have independently been argued to project what Chomsky (2000) calls `phases'. The generalization is that phase heads cannot be stranded. Chapter 2 derives the ban against stranding phase heads within a derivational model of the grammar. The effect of phases on successive cyclicity is the following: To be licit, movement out of a phase must pass through the specifier position of that phase. The idea of the account is that every step of movement must establish a relation between the moved item and some other element in the phrase marker which is in a well-defined sense closer than the relation they were in prior to movement. Movement from complement to specifier position within the same phrase never achieves this. In fact, any movement within the same phrase is in effect too short to achieve this. There are then well-defined anti-locality effects, which fallout from considerations of local economy. The ban against stranding phase heads now follows. A category can leave its containing phase only by passing through its specifier position. Since complements cannot reach the specifier position in the same phrase, the complements of phase heads cannot move away. Head Movement is prohibited by the same economy based reasoning. Chapter 5 focuses on Head Movement, advocating a version of Brody's (2000) Mirror Theory. In contrast to standard theories of Head Movement, Mirror Theory predicts what looks like downward Head Movement to be possible. Data from VP-ellipsis in English show that this prediction of Mirror Theory is correct.},

  abstract = {Match Theory (Selkirk 2011) and approaches to syntax-prosody mapping involving alignment and Wrap(XP) (Truckenbrodt 1995, 1999) insist that syntatic phrases at least partially map onto phonological phrases. Each approach specifies that certain XPs are visible for mapping, while others are not. Both Truckenbrodt (1999) and Selkirk (2011) suggest that when an XP hosts an adjunct, only the lower segment of that XP is visible at the interface. We undertake several case studies of these theories' predictions, drawing primarily on data from phrasing in the Bantu language Kinyambo (Bickmore 1990), in order to address the proper interpretation of syntactic adjunction structures at the syntax-phonology interface. To do so, we employ a new JavaScript application which we have developed, Syntax-Prosody in Optimality Theory (SPOT; Bellik, Bellik, \& Kalivoda 2016) allowing us to automatically generate and evaluate prosodic tree structures of arbitrary length and depth. We conclude that high segments of XP in syntactic adjunction structures must be visible to Match (pace Selkirk 2011) in order to predict attested prosodic phrasings in Kinyambo, and that treatments of adjunction which ignore the highest segment of a maximal projection make surprising and possibly problematic predictions.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we argue that a recurring pattern of partial correlations among word order variation and scope possibilities (which we dub the 34 signature) supports a particular view of economy constraints in syntax, specifically one that has the following properties: i. There are economy conditions (soft constraints) that value a particular type of corre- spondence between LF and PF representations. ii. These constraints are uni-directional: LF (broadly construed) is calculated first, and determines PF (surface word order). iii. Scope rigidity is not a property of languages, but of specific configurations, and the distribution of rigidity effects is (largely) predictable from independent variation in the syntactic resources of various languages. The view that we put forward is a synthesis of a number of existing proposals. Assump- tion i. is common to a variety of frameworks, notably the Economy framework (Chomsky 1991) in addition to frameworks that are exclusively constraint-based, including Optimal- ity Theory. We focus here on the interaction of these three assumptions, and the role of ii. in predicting the 34 signature effect. We contrast our proposal with competitors, in par- ticular the Interface Economy model of Reinhart (2005), in which economy conditions are held to regulate a mapping that takes overt structure as its input and yields permissi- ble interpretations.},

It argues that A-moving quantifiers do not usually exhibit reconstruction effects because arguments are interpreted in the position where their uninterpretable Case feature is erased. It shows how the Case-checking condition on scope taking can be obviated in the case of indefinites by means of covert insertion of an expletive, and goes on to provide arguments that lowered readings of indefinites involve literal lowering. This movement is subject to Relativized Minimality, thereby further supporting the claim that Quantifier Movement is a syntactic operation. The paper considers the possibility that such an account can be reconciled with the idea that copies left by A-movement necessarily delete, and argues that this is possible only if the derivational character of syntax is strengthened.},

Phrasal phonological domains can instead be defined directly in the syntax. In this response, we argue that Modular PIC does not provide a convincing new approach to the syntax-phonology interface, as it is both too powerful and too restrictive. We show that the analysis offered of raddoppiamento fonosintattico in Eastern Abruzzese does not justify the loss of restrictiveness Modular PIC brings to phase theory. We also show that Modular PIC is too restrictive to account for phenomena, from Bantu languages and others, that have received satisfactory analyses within interface theories that appeal to prosodic constituents. We conclude that Modular PIC does not successfully replace prosodic constituent approaches to the interface.},

As in the early approach, there is no feature checking in intermediate positions of successive-cyclic movement. However, as in the current approach and unlike in early minimalism, successive-cyclic movement starts before the final target of movement enters the structure, and Form Chain is eliminated. The locality of Move and the locality of Agree are shown to be radically different, Agree being free from several mechanisms that constrain Move, namely, phases and the Activation Condition. However, there is no need to take phases to define locality domains of syntax or to posit the Activation Condition as an independent principle. They still hold empirically for Move as theorems. The Generalized EPP (the "I need a Spec" property of attracting heads) and the Inverse Case Filter are also dispensable. The traditional Case Filter, stated as a checking requirement, is the sole driving force of A-movement. More generally, Move is always driven by a formal inadequacy (an uninterpretable feature) of the moving element, while Agree is target driven. The system resolves a lookahead problem that arises under the EPP-driven movement approach, where the EPP diacritic indicating that X moves is placed on Y, not X, although X often needs to start moving before Y enters the structure.},

  abstract = {It has long been assumed in linguistics that bound variable interpretations of pronouns are possible (only) when a quantified expression c-commands the pronoun. In two studies in which readers' eye movements were recorded, we examined the processing of pronouns bound by universal quantifiers. Experiment 1 compared examples where the quantifier c-commands the pronoun (`Every British soldier thought he killed an enemy soldier') with examples where it doesn't (`Every British soldier aimed and then he killed an enemy soldier'). Although there were no first pass differences, re-reading time showed that both quantifier examples took longer to read than nonquantified controls (`The old British soldier. . . '), but there was no special penalty in examples when the quantifier failed to c-command the pronoun. Experiment 2 investigated intersentential binding (telescoping): `John Frederick/Each executive/Every executive went home. He broiled a steak. He ate dinner. Then he watched television.' Second pass and total reading times in the region containing the first pronoun were longer for quantified examples than name examples. But there was no indication that telescoping is tightly restricted, for example, to contexts with `each' or to discourses describing stereotypical events composed of predictable subevents. The results suggest that bound variable interpretations are more generally and more readily available than is often assumed. They fit well with Bosch's (1983) attempt to limit pronoun occurrences to just two types: anaphoric referential pronouns and syntactic agreement pronouns. On this view, `bound variable' interpretations without c-command are really anaphoric pronouns with inferred antecedents. This view is discussed along with the challenges it faces.},

In particular, it challenges the status of bare nominals as indefinites, providing contexts in which English uses the indefinite article but an article-less language like Hindi must resort to a numeral construction. The empirical generalization based on Hindi is that bare nominals are ambiguous between definites and kind terms and that bare plurals, but not bare singulars, can have kind derived indefinite readings. The indefinite readings available to bare singulars must be traced to external factors. The paper then provides an explanation for these facts within a Neo-Carlsonian approach to bare nominals, addressing the issue of null determiners vs covert type shifts. The last section of the paper extends the insights gained from the case study of Hindi bare nominals to other languages, highlighting empirical and theoretical issues of relevance in determining whether bare nominals in a given language are definites or indefinites. It also comments on the well-established fact that adult learners of a language like English have trouble with the determiner system if their L1 does not have articles from the vantage point of the findings about Hindi bare nominals.},

  abstract = {The gap between a definite and an indefinite is reduced in the case of specific indefinites, in the sense that they both have determined reference. This fact is reflected in most accounts, particularly so in the analysis of Schwarzschild (2002) where specific indefinites are argued to quantify over singleton sets. If definites and specific indefinites share the singleton domain property, how are we to separate the two? The Privacy Principle, which is cued to the information state of discourse participants, is argued to apply to definites as well as indefinites (among other quantifiers), making it even harder to draw the line between definites and specific indefinites. We look at issues surrounding the distinction between definiteness and specificity through the lens of two empirical phenomena, bare nominals and specificity markers. Bare nominals in languages with determiners, for example English, and bare nominals in languages without determiners, for example Hindi, highlight different aspects of the problem. English bare plurals are known to have indefinite readings but not specific indefinite readings. Hindi bare nominals are thought to have definite and indefinite readings but can be shown not to have specific indefinite readings. The second empirical phenomena we consider are specificity markers like certain. In many languages they require a determiner in the singular but not in the plural, raising questions about their syntactic status as determiners or modifiers. They also do not occur in certain constructions, for example imperatives. Probing such restrictions provides a window into their semantic profile. This paper thus presents some puzzles that center around the creation of singleton sets and its relation to the Privacy Principle.},

On the syntactic side, the primary issue is whether bare nouns have a null determiner making all noun phrases structurally uniform. On the semantic side, the primary issue involves determining and deriving the range of permissible readings. Of primary significance are the availability of definite and indefinite readings for bare nouns and how such readings relate to the presence or absence of lexical exponents of (in)definiteness in a language. Further refinements include the special scope properties of kind terms versus regular indefinites, differences between singular and plural kind terms, number distinctions within the noun phrase, and the role of incorporation. We present the theoretical and typological advances that have been made in addressing these issues and identify which considerations are purely syntactic or purely semantic in nature and which considerations have implications for the interface.},

Previous approaches, working under the assumption that the order in (ii) did not exist, focussed on the derivation of (iii) from (i), generally assuming the fronting of the adjective to be a single movement operation. In recent years, however, it has been shown that not only does the order in (ii) exist, but the choice between (i-iii) is not semantically neutral. Hence to account for the order in (ii), I propose that the fronting of the adjective and noun to be a result of two separate movement operations: head movement of N to D and phrasal movement of AP to Spec-DP. I propose that the orders in (ii-iv) are a direct result of D's attractiveness.},

The approach taken here is a direct reference approach in which apparent mismatches between morphosyntactic domains and phonological domains are derived from the spell-out procedure. The analysis relies on two main ingredients, i) inclusion of the output of spell-out in subsequent cycles, and ii) layering of concatenation. Under (i), the phonological output of spell-out is visible and can be affected, however the internal structure~is not. This can yield the effects of phonological domains extending beyond the morphosyntactic domain. Under (ii), processes are specified to apply at either early or late concatenation, where early and late concatenation are determined~by the selectional relationship between the elements, limiting the application of phonological processes within the spell-out domain.

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2018 Springer Nature B.V. We argue that head movement, as an operation that builds head-adjunction structures in the syntax, has been used to model two empirically distinct classes of phenomena. One class has to do with displacement of heads (fully formed morphological words) to higher syntactic positions, and includes phenomena like verb second and verb initiality. The other class has to do with the construction of complex morphological words and is involved in various types of word formation. Based on the very different clusters of properties associated with these two classes of phenomena, we argue that they each should be accounted for by distinct grammatical operations, applying in distinct modules of the grammar, rather than by the one traditional syntactic head movement operation. We propose that the operation responsible for upward displacement of heads is genuine syntactic movement (Internal Merge) and has the properties of syntactic phrasal movement, including the ability to affect word order, the potential to give rise to interpretive effects, and the locality associated with Internal Merge. On the other hand, word formation is the result of postsyntactic amalgamation, realized as either Lowering (Embick and Noyer 2001) or its upward counterpart, Raising. This operation, we argue, has properties that are not associated with narrow syntax: it is morphologically driven, it results in word formation, it does not exhibit interpretive effects, and it has stricter locality conditions (the Head Movement Constraint). The result is a view of head movement that not only accounts for the empirical differences between the two classes of head movement phenomena, but also lays to rest numerous perennial theoretical problems that have heretofore been associated with the syntactic head adjunction view of head movement. In addition, the framework developed here yields interesting new predictions with respect to the expected typology of head movement patterns.},

One crucial aspect of the proposed theory of structural symmetry involves interweaving effects, which emerge as categorial determination of different sizes and types. The present thesis discusses three such cases: Nominative-Genitive Conversion, Head-Internal Relative Clauses, and Predicate Cleft Constructions. It is further argued that Agreement Symmetry and Structural Symmetry interact with the Case theory and bring far-reaching implications for aspects of syntactic phenomena.},

Overt movement of the blocking category will always pave the way for Object Shift. The interplay between Object Shift and Verb Topicalization (verb movement to specCP) shows (a) that it makes no difference to Object Shift how the verb moves, as long as it moves, (b) that Holmberg's Generalization is a matter of derivation, not representation, and (c) that Object Shift does not observe the strict cycle. It is proposed that Object Shift applies after insertion of pholological features in a component of stylistic rules, containing rules dependent on focus structure.},

In this paper, we will refer to these variants as -en- Of the 23,000 Dutch noun\textemdash noun compounds that are listed in the celex lexical database (Baayen, Piepenbrock, \& Gulikers, 1995), 31\% contain either a linking -s- (20\%) or a linking -en-(11\%). This distribution is different for compounds in which a derived noun appears as left constituent (17\% of the 23,000 compounds). Derived left constituents almost always occur with a linking element (-s-: 62.7\%; -en- 32.8\%; -\o -: 4.6\%). Linking elements are thus typical for derived forms, although they also occur with other left constituents. In addition to this general preference of derived forms to occur with linking elements, specific suffixes also tend to occur with particular linking elements. For instance, the diminutive suffix -tje and its allomorphs are always followed by the linking -s-.The suffix -heid (similar to English -ness), even though it appears with all three linking possibilities (-s-, -en-,and -\o -), evidences a very strong preference: 99\% of all such compounds select -s-. These strong restrictions are also effective in the case of novel compounds (Krott, Baayen, \& Schreuder, 2001; Krott, Schreuder, \& Baayen, in press).},

  abstract = {In modeling the effects of the Person-Case Constraint (PCC), a common claim is that 3rd person ``is not a person''. However, while this claim does work in the syntax, it creates problems in the morphology. For example, characterizing the well-known ``spurious se effect'' in Spanish simply cannot be done without reference to 3rd person. Inspired by alternatives to underspecification that have emerged in phonology (e.g., Calabrese, 1995), a revised featural system is proposed, whereby syntactic agreement may be relativized to certain values of a feature, in particular, the contrastive and marked values. The range of variation in PCC effects is shown to emerge as a consequence of the parametric options allowed on a Probing head, whereas the representation of person remains constant across modules of the grammar and across languages.},

  abstract = {This paper capitalizes on the difference between person complementarity (e.g. PCC effects) and omnivorous number (e.g. the fact that a single plural marker can be used to cross-reference more than one plural argument) by proposing that the same syntactic mechanism of Multiple Agree is responsible for both. The widely divergent surface difference results from the fact that person features are fully binary, whereas number features are syntactically privative. Additionally, arguments drawn from a variety of verbal cross-referencing morphemes implicating phi-interactions between subject and object support the claim that these elements are clitics, necessitating a principled morphosyntactic difference between clitics and other DPs undergoing object shift, and revisitation of the clitic-affix distinction.},

We identify an accessibility hierarchy of nominal categories in which the MLP can be expressed. is hierarchy is consistent with all 17 languages with MLPs we have found. We show that this accessibility hierarchy (pronoun\textexclamdown{} proper noun\textexclamdown{} kinship term\textexclamdown{} common noun) is a function of the intrinsic discourse-pragmatic features of these nominal categories. While the categorical restriction to pronoun and proper noun possessors in Icelandic, German, and Russian may be largely grammaticized, we show that the discourse-pragmatic constraint is recognizably active in Czech and Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian. ese results complement studies that attempt to understand how language structure responds to communicative forces and processing constraints.},

We combine this conception with a proposal that valuation and interpretability of features are independent concepts. We specifically focus on the role of verbal tense morphology in specifying other properties of a sentence, and the comparable role played by wh-morphology in specifying clause type.We concentrate on the syntax of raising constructions and an analysis of sentential subjects.},

On the one hand it is believed that the same conditions that govern the interpretation of anaphora also govern syntactic movement rules but on the other, while anaphora is known to interact with various discourse and semantic considerations, it also provides a clear instance of the dependency of the semantic interpretation of sentences upon semantic properties of natural language. This book has two major goals: the first is a comprehensive analysis of sentence-level anaphora that addresses the questions posed above, and the second is an examination of the broader issues of the relations between the structural properties of sentences and their semantic interpretation within the hypotheses of the autonomy of syntax and of interpretative semantics shown by Chomsky.},

The solution: A theory of how syntactic structures are mapped onto functional and lexical words, positing syntactic features w for lexical access points and @ for linearization points. The theory draws on the late insertion of DM, the cycles of phase theory, the direct linearization principles of MT, and the non-terminal spell-out of Nanosyntax, separating word formation from linearization and appealing to spans (head-complement sequences) as the units of cyclic lexical access and storage.},

  abstract = {This article investigates the temporal and aspectual composition of infinitival complementation structures in English. I show that previous classifications of tense in infinitives are insufficient in that they do not cover the entire spectrum of infinitival constructions in English. Using the distribution of nongeneric, nonstative, episodic interpretations as a main characteristic, I show that infinitival constructions fall into three classes: future irrealis infinitives, which allow episodic interpretations with bare VPs; simultaneous infinitives that do not allow episodic interpretations; and simultaneous infinitives that allow episodic interpretations depending on the matrix tense. I argue that the three classes of infinitives are derived from the following properties: future infinitives are tenseless but involve a syntactically present future modal woll; simultaneous propositional attitude infinitives impose the NOW of the propositional attitude holder as the reference time of the infinitive; and certain simultaneous infinitives form a single temporal domain with the matrix clause. The analysis proposed has consequences for the composition of tense and aspect, the syntax of infinitives, and the way selection is determined. \textcopyright{} 2014 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

One of the main observations is that QR from different types of clausal complements is gradient and speakers' acceptance of non-local inverse scope tracks syntactic complexity defined over clausal domains. The account develops a preliminary algorithm for calculating processing costs based on the complexity of the structure, which in turn is reflected in the number of steps QR has to undergo in a cyclic movement approach to inverse scope.},

  abstract = {Working on the computation of roots in Chinese compounds, this paper presents six major differences between the merger of roots in compound formation and the merger of elements in phrase structure formation: the existence of exocentric structures, the freedom of projectivity, the disappearance of subcategorization, the double licensing of formal features, the effect of Lexical Integrity in movement, and such an effect in pronominalization. All of these differences are accounted for by the hypothesis that roots do not have syntactic features. Moreover, this paper studies a case of merger level underspecification in languages that allow nouns and verbs to occur without any inflection: in the absence of a syntactic context, an isolated string of two elements can be ambiguous between the root-merger that eventually gives rise to a verb and the merger of a verb and its object that gives rise to a VP.},

Three arguments are presented: (i) English \emph{whether/Q...or} questions present at the same time movement characteristics (sensitivity to islands) and ellipsis traits (focus pattern on the disjuncts); (ii) crosslinguistic data on the surface string syntax of Subject-Object-Verb languages support the ellipsis plus movement account in general and, thus, indirectly also for English; and (iiii) certain asymmetries between \emph{whether/Q...or }and \emph{either...or} are resolved, permitting a unified account of the two types of constructions.},

I compare Chomsky's three successive theories of strong features and argue that two ellipsis phenomena, pseudogapping and sluicing, provide evidence bearing on the nature of strong features. I argue that movement or ellipsis can rescue a derivation with a strong feature, and I conclude that PF crash is relevant either directly, as in Chomsky 1993, or indirectly, as in the theory presented in Chomsky 1995a augmented by the multiple-chain theory of pied-piping (especially as interpreted by Ochi (1998)).},

@book{amekakropp2008,
	abstract = {This book explores the thesis that in the Kwa languages of West Africa, aspect and modality are more central to the grammar of the verb than tense. Where tense marking has emerged it is invariably in the expression of the future, and therefore concerned with the impending actualization or potentiality of an event, hence with modality, rather than the purely temporal sequencing associated with tense. The primary grammatical contrasts are perfective versus imperfective. The main languages discussed are Akan, Dangme, Ewe, Ga and Tuwuli while Nzema-Ahanta, Likpe and Eastern Gbe are also mentioned. Knowledge about these languages has deepened considerably during the past decade or so and ideas about their structure have changed. The volume therefore presents novel analyses of grammatical forms like the so-called S-Aux-O-V-Other or ``future'' constructions, and provides empirical data for theorizing about aspect and modality. It should be of considerable interest to Africanist linguists, typologists, and creolists interested in substrate issues.},

	abstract = {Since the earliest days of generative grammar, control has been distinguished from raising: the latter the product of movement operations, the former the result of construal processes relating a PRO to an antecedent. This article argues that obligatory control structures are also formed by movement. Minimalism makes this approach viable by removing D-Structure as a grammatical level. Implementing the suggestion, however, requires eliminating the last vestiges of D-Structure still extant in Chomsky's (1995) version of the Minimalist Program. In particular, it requires dispensing with the θ-Criterion and adopting the view that θ-roles are featurelike in being able to license movement.},
